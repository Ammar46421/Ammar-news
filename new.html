                    “We have passed through a very difficult time, but workers and leaders are standing by the party
                    founder Imran Khan like a rock. The enthusiasm of workers has given me hope that a new dawn will
                    emerge on Feb 8,” Mr Qaiser said.

                    “I have been in jail, been investigated in various cases, and there was a lot of pressure on me, but
                    I stood with Imran Khan,” he remarked. He declared he would live and die with Imran Khan.

                <p>The other PTI leaders said the party’s nominated candidates would win if the elections were held in a
                    free and fair manner. They said it was the responsibility of the Election Commission of Pakistan to
                    ensure transparent elections.</p>
                <p>The convention was also addressed by Rangaiz Khan, who is contesting elections from PK-49, Swabi-1.

                <p>Meanwhile, members of Dispute Resolution Council (DRC) of Razaar tehsil, during a meeting on
                    Saturday, called on the candidates to avoid creating the situation like the 2018 elections when an
                    educated youth belonging to PTI was killed on the Election Day in the PK-53 constituency here.</p>
                <p>All candidates, including independents, from NA-20, PK-52 and PK-53, ulema and police officials
                    attended the meeting, which was aimed to adopt a strategy to ensure holding of peaceful elections.
                </p>
                <p>The participants said losing candidates must accept the defeat with open heart, and avoid resorting
                    to any violent activities.</p>
                <p>The participants stressed that the candidates and their supporters should ensure full compliance with
                    the election code of conduct.</p>
                <p>Maulana Mufti Mohammad Farooq, who presided over the meeting, highlighted the measures taken by DRC
                    Razaar to maintain law and order on the Election Day.</p>
                <p>DRC general secretary Haji Sohail Ahmad stressed the need for the cooperation of all the stakeholders
                    for holding peaceful elections.</p>
                <p>The contesting candidates were asked not to display posters on government buildings and not to hold
                    gatherings and processions near educational institutions.</p>
                <p>The candidates agreed to conduct election campaign in a peaceful and legal manner.</p>
                <p>A peace committee was constituted to oversee measures being taken to ensure peace and order during
                    the electoral process.</p>
                <p>Police officials said they were committed to maintaining law and order during the election campaign
                    and on the polling day.</p>
