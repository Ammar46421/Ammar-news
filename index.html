        <h2>Gaza death toll crosses 25,000 as Israel-Hamas war drags on</h2>

          The Palestinian death toll in Gaza from over three months of war
          between Israel and the territory's Hamas rulers has soared past
          25,000, the Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday. <br />
          At least 178 bodies were brought to Gaza's hospitals in 24 hours along
          with nearly 300 wounded people, according to Health Ministry
          spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra. Women and children are the main victims
          in the Israel-Hamas war, according to the United Nations. The war
          began with Hamas' surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, in which
          Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and
          took around 250 hostage, including men, women and children. Israel
          responded with a three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion
          into northern Gaza that flattened entire neighborhoods. Ground
          operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and
          built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war
          surrounding Israel's creation.

          Some 85% of Gaza’s population have fled their homes, with hundreds of
          thousands packing into U.N.-run shelters and tent camps in the
          southern part of the tiny coastal enclave. U.N. officials say a
          quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle
          of humanitarian aid enters because of the fighting and Israeli
          restrictions. Gaza’s Health Ministry says a total of 25,105
          Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Oct. 7, and
          another 62,681 have been wounded. Al-Qidra said many casualties remain
          buried under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in areas where medics
          cannot reach them. The ministry does not differentiate between
          civilians and combatants in its death toll but says around two-thirds
          of those killed were women and minors.
