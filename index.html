        <h2>Gaza death toll crosses 25,000 as Israel-Hamas war drags on</h2>
        <p>
          At least 178 bodies were brought to Gaza's hospitals in 24 hours along
          with nearly 300 wounded people, according to Health Ministry
        </p>

          The Palestinian death toll in Gaza from over three months of war
          between Israel and the territory's Hamas rulers has soared past
          25,000, the Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday. <br />
          <br />
          At least 178 bodies were brought to Gaza's hospitals in 24 hours along
          with nearly 300 wounded people, according to Health Ministry
          spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra. Women and children are the main victims
          in the Israel-Hamas war, according to the United Nations. <br /><br />
          The war began with Hamas' surprise attack into Israel on Oct.
          <br /><br />
          7, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly
          civilians, and took around 250 hostage, including men, women and
          children. <br /><br />
          Israel responded with a three-week air campaign and then a ground
          invasion into northern Gaza that flattened entire neighborhoods.
          Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis
          and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war
          surrounding Israel's creation.

          Some 85% of Gaza’s population have fled their homes, with hundreds of
          thousands packing into U.N.-run shelters and tent camps in the
          southern part of the tiny coastal enclave. <br /><br />
          U.N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is
          starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid enters because of the
          fighting and Israeli restrictions. <br /><br />
          Gaza’s Health Ministry says a total of 25,105 Palestinians have been
          killed in the territory since Oct. 7, and another 62,681 have been
          wounded. <br />
          <br />
          Al-Qidra said many casualties remain buried under the rubble from
          Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them. The
          ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in
          its death toll but says around two-thirds of those killed were women
          and minors.
