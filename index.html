        The Palestinian death toll in Gaza from over three months of war
        between Israel and the territory's Hamas rulers has soared past
        25,000, the Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday. </p>

        At least 178 bodies were brought to Gaza's hospitals in 24 hours along
        with nearly 300 wounded people, according to Health Ministry
        spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra. Women and children are the main victims
        in the Israel-Hamas war, according to the United Nations. <br /><br />
        The war began with Hamas' surprise attack into Israel on Oct.
        <br /><br />
        7, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly
        civilians, and took around 250 hostage, including men, women and
        children. <br /><br />
        Israel responded with a three-week air campaign and then a ground
        invasion into northern Gaza that flattened entire neighborhoods.
        Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis
        and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war
        surrounding Israel's creation.

      <p>
        Some 85% of Gaza’s population have fled their homes, with hundreds of
        thousands packing into U.N.-run shelters and tent camps in the
        southern part of the tiny coastal enclave. <br /><br />
        U.N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is
        starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid enters because of the
        fighting and Israeli restrictions. <br /><br />
        Gaza’s Health Ministry says a total of 25,105 Palestinians have been
        killed in the territory since Oct. 7, and another 62,681 have been
        wounded. <br />
        <br />
        Al-Qidra said many casualties remain buried under the rubble from
        Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them. The
        ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in
        its death toll but says around two-thirds of those killed were women
        and minors.
